is a part of the system that, if it fails the whole entire system stops from working.
9.Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
The downtime period might be longer than expected because the server is dependant on  one code base which at the moment is not available.The server requires to restart hence no way users will access the website in that period.
10. Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic
The domain name  directly accesses to and from the server ,and the infrastructure doesn't have a load balancer which handles increased loads easier.This posses an issue to the volume of users trying to access a website content and the system is overloaded.
